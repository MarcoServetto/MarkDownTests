The Fearless compiler produces an optimised representation
of the source code that can then be executed by the Fearless runtime.

Comments are another tool to make our code more readable or clear.
Comments are ignored by the fearless compiler
in the same way extra spacing is ignored.

A line starting with `//` is a single line comment.
The whole line is ignored by the Fearless compiler.
Any text enclosed by the delimiters `/*...*~/` 
is called a multi-line comment and it is also ignored by the
Fearless compiler.
Additional spaces and newlines can be added mostly anywhere in the
code and are also ignored; that is, comments and extra spaces do
not play any role in the optimised representation produced by
the Fearless compiler, and thus will have no impact on the execution.

That is, comments have no impact on the execution;
but can be precious to insert human-readable explanations in the code; facilitating the understanding (and re understanding) of code.


It only works for these four, specific directions.
What would happen if we wanted to add more directions 
(`NorthEast`, `NorthWest`, etc.).
We would have to manually calculate the resulting direction.
This is a programming anti-pattern and should be avoided.
